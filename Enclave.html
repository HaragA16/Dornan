        <br>Don't have any? You expect me to believe that, maggot? The truth is you lost an expensive piece of army-issue equipment. </br>
        <br>That suit is going to come out of your pay, and you will remain in this man's army until you are five hundred and ten years old, </br>
        <br>which is the number of years it will take for you to pay for a Mark II Powered Combat Armor you have lost! </br>
        <br>Report to the armory and have a new suit issued to you, then report back to me, private! Dismissed! </br>
